# COPO-IDs

This project is designed to be a high level tool to create COPO object IDs. There should only ever be one instance of this running and it should serve IDs to all other COPO instances.

'id_gen' is the django project directory, 'make_id' is the id generation application directory. For further info see the Django documentation.
